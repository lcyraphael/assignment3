				<h3> Buddy Cop Comedies </h3>
				<img class = "buddy_cop" src = "Movies%20Photos/rush_hour.jpg" alt = "Rush Hour" />
				<img class = "buddy_cop" src = "Movies%20Photos/rush_hour_2.jpg" alt = "Rush Hour 2" />
				<img class = "buddy_cop" src = "Movies%20Photos/21_jump_street.jpg" alt = "21 Jump Street" />
				<p>
					One of my favorite genres. Buddy cop comedies just hit the spot for me, and it all started with <em>Rush Hour</em>. The one-two punch of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan redefined the buddy cop dynamic, and gave it a much more playful quality. I mean, it's not exactly <em>Lethal Weapon 2</em>. Then, we were given one of the best sequels ever in <em>Rush Hour 2</em>, which bordered on the verge of ridiculous at times but never fails to put a smile on my face. Lastly, if you haven't seen <em>21 Jump Street</em>, then get off the site right now and watch it. It's a surprisingly clever, extremely self-referential and thoroughly outrageous. The Tatum-Hill dynamic is a winner in this one.

				<h3> Matrial Art</h3>

				<img class = "martial" src="Movies%20Photos/13_assassins.jpg" alt = "13 Assassins" />
				<p>
					Another one of my favorites! Martial art movies have been blowing my mind since 1992 and I love it. There's a great spectrum of martial art movies out there, enough that there's something for every taste. Personally, I was mesmerized young by <em>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</em>, even though it took my a solid decade to realize where the title came from (it's a scene between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, outside while talking and drinking tea; it gives the whole movie a slightly different feel).
				</p>
				<p>
					 Anyway, <em>Crouching Tiger</em> stunned me with a mix of elegance, poise and fierce badassery but it still wasn't close to <em>Ip Man</em>. The slightly (read: overly) exaggerated accounting of Bruce Li's master during World War 2 is quite simply amazing. Just watch it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, the Samurai subgenre of the martial art movie. This last one is a recent find, but I'm hugely thankful I stumbled upon it. <em>13 Assassins</em>, is a wonderful example f the subgenre, as the plot revolves around twelve elite Samurai and one thief as they plan to go against the largest Samurai clan in order to kill the evil/psychotic brother of the Shogun. The great thing about the Samurai subgenre is the topic of Bushido: the Samurai code of honor. Having even just a small glimpse into this world of duty and discipline is spine-tinglingy awesome, and <em>13 Assassins</em> does not disappoint.

				<h3> The Epics</h3>
				<img class = "epic" src="Movies%20Photos/star_wars.jpg" alt = "Star Wars" />
				<img class = "epic" src="Movies%20Photos/pirates.jpg" alt = "Pirates of the Caribbean" />
				<img class = "epic" src="Movies%20Photos/lord_of_the_rings.jpg" alt = "The Lord of the Rings" />
				<p>
					These movies need no introduciton. You've seen them. I've seen them. Only my grandmother hasn't seen them, but even she's read the plot on the Wikipedia.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Star Wars</em> is possibly the greatest saga of the last half century. Or at least, it was until George Lucas was given full creative control and used it to give us Jar-Jar Binks and midi-chlorians. Oh well, the originally trilogy is still amazing so there's no need to remember Hayden Christensen.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> also redefinied the fantasy AND epic genres. You'll notice that nothing of the sort has been made since (except <em>The Hobbit</em> hint-hint) and it single handedly kept anyone from realizing that Russell Crowe gave a stellar performance in <em>Master and Commander</em>. With such an amazingly complex world and an even more convoluted history, traveling to Middle Earth is a trip everyone should make. At least thrice.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally, yes. I do count <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> as an epic, and almost as a saga. Good ol' Captain Jack Sparrow is an immediate crowd-pleaser as well as your teen's worst role model. That being said, Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance and provides us a solid two hours of laughs and cries. My favorite <em>Pirates</em> movies? It goes: 1, 3, 4, 2.

				<h3> The "Always Good" Movies</h3>
				<img class = "good" src="Movies%20Photos/3_idiots.jpg" alt = "3 Idiots" />
				<img class = "good" src="Movies%20Photos/12_angry_men_title.jpg" alt = "12 Angry Men" />
				<img class = "good" src="Movies%20	Photos/fight_club.jpg" alt = "Fight Club" />
				<p>
					Finally, I leave you with a brief collection of some of my all-time favorites. If you've seen any of these movies, you already know what I mean. If you haven't, well then buckle up because it's a hell of a ride.
				</p>
				<p>
					A great place to start: <em>3 Idiots</em>. A friend of mine put it best; this is a great movie to watch if you're a student, if you're worried about the future, and if you're at a crossroads. Personally, I like to think that it's a great movie to watch whenever you watch it. In the 160 minutes feature we follow Fahran and Raju, two old friends from Engineering School, as they go on a crazy trip to find their old third musketeer: Rancho. As they search far and wide, we get treated to flashbacks to their time together at the fictional Imperial College of Engineering. No other movie I've seen has ever toyed with my emotions so effortlessly, as <em>3 Idiots</em> will make you cry, then throw in a derailing one-liner before hitting you over the head with melodrama again. Also, the songs are just wonderful; I wish I could have been there when they filmed the scene for "Aal Izz Well".
				</p>
				<p>
					Another classic, <em>12 Angry Men</em> tells the story of a jury in a murder case. One room, twelve men and 96 minutes stand between you and the gripping resolution of the search for a unanimous decision in this 1957 masterpiece. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb play amazingly off of one another, and it gives us a nice flash into life half a century ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally, my mother would never let me hear the end of it if I made a Movies page and did not include Edward Norton. Playing across Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, Edward Norton brings life to Chuck Palahniuk's novel behind the direction of David Fincher. Just in case you've never seen <em>Fight Club</em> (which is considered a crime in some states), I'll keep from spoiling anything. Just watch it, ok?
