			<h2> My Lifelong Love of Sports</h2>

				<p>
					I couldn't even begin to count the number of times I've had an athlete friend call me a NARP, a Non-Athletic Regular Person. Granted, I don't compete in any sport, and I haven't in a long time; not since playing basketball for my British high school in Greece in 2008 (<strong>definitely</strong> doesn't feel like five years). But despite this, I've loved sports wholeheartedly since a young age. It probably had something to do with my being a secret baseball prodigy. I mean, just look at me. I clearly know what I'm doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alas, it was not meant to be. I moved to Paris and the name of the game was football (or soccer for our friends in the States). But as an eight year old with large hands, flat feet and a solid few inches over most-everyone else my age, I quickly came to realize that football was not the game for me. I switched to basketball, and have never looked back.

				<h3>Basketball and the Celtics</h3>
				<p>
					Now, I love the Boston Celtics. Don't get me wrong, I love the game of basketball in and of itself. I love to watch it, I love to play it, and I love to talk about it (excessively so, if my friends are to be believed). And that is why the Celtics are far and away my favorite team of any sort. But the question I often get asked is why I'm a Celtics fan at all. I'm not from Boston, my family isn't from Boston, so what gives?
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, it's a two part answer. WhenI started playing basketball as a kid, there was one other boy on the team who spoke English. He was clearly the best player there, and I was clearly the tallest so we got along swimingly. He had spent enough time in the States to grow familiar with the NBA, and since he was born in Boston and raised in Seattle his teams were the Celtics and the Sonics. So, eight year old me figured that he might as well start following those teams too as a place to start. It didn't hurt that my Dad had gone to college in Boston. Well, that's an understatement; he <strong>studied</strong> in Boston, from 1976 to 1987 (I think). He was around to watch Larry Bird play in his prime, so naturally he hasn't followed basketball since. Seriously, he missed Kobe's entire career.
				</p>
				<p>
					But when it comes down to it, I love the Celtics because they play basketball that I love to watch. They give 110%, they never give up, they focus on defense and teamwork, and they do it all <strong>really well</strong>. I know it's an old argument, but you really can't argue with 17 rings. Or, you know, requiring a word like "eight-peat" to be coined.

				<h3>Football and PSG</h3>
				<p>
					Now, I'll admit I don't care for football, American or European, nearly as much as I do for basketball. But, I went to school in Saint Germain as a kid and in Paris as a 'young adult' (read: a marginally older kid) so I feel like I must have <strong>some</strong> kind of connection to this team. The PSG has gone through good times, getting Ronaldinho for a few years, then through some pretty bad times, fading from people's minds for a few more. But now, the good times have been brought back ever since the Qatar Investment Authority bought the team. Yes, you read that right. It's nice to think that every time someone pumps gas, a few cents go to my home team. Ha.
				</p>
				<p>
					Right now, my interest in the team is at an all-time high and the team is more stacked than it's been in years. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva were added at the beginning of last season and have been creating a lot of excitement on offense and defense respectively. Add a young Lucas Moura, a 19 year old Brazilian player with a scary top speed, and the older veteran David Beckham and it's hard not to love these guys. Unless you're from Marseille.
