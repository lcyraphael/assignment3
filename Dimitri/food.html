					Dimitri 101: I love food. It's really that simple, I love food as much as anything, and more than most things. And as much as I love to cook and eat, I also love to sleep, so instead of walking you through all the thoughts that constantly go through my mind (<strong>all</strong> about food) I'm going to leave you with a little photo album of what I think each dish or meal should look like. You'll see what I mean.

					But first things first: here's when I took a small cooking class. It was right about the same time that I tried fresh durian for the first time. If you're ever in a position where you have to answer the question "<em>should I try this really, really, <strong>really</strong> stinky fruit</em>?" I'll save you the trouble. Taste it. It's worth it.
