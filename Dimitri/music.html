			<h2> Your New Favorite Jukebox </h2>
			<p>
				When I was a kid and someone asked me what kind of music I liked, I would always answer the same way: <em>'I like anything with a good beat'</em>. Going into seventh grade, I was twelve years old, I had just started drumming. I had never listened to  music much, and then all of a sudden it felt as if the floodgates had opened. I was being introduced to so many new genres, artists and songs, and I held on to as much as I could.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few years down the road, all of a sudden I'm sixteen and moving back to Paris to start my Junior year of high school. Three weeks into the school year, and I meet one of my best friends to date. Thanks to him, I was introduced to the amazing world of Hip Hop and I was immediately hooked. And that doesn't just include rap or even American music; the French Hip Hop scene and culture hit me like the best feeling ton of bricks in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				And now, here we are, looking back at my musical history and my God does it look disjointed. But that's part of the fun, right?

				<h3>Something Happy</h3>

				</figure>
				<p>
					Ok, easy place to start: <strong>The Cat Empire</strong>. These guys are hands down my favorite band. It's hard to describe what makes the Empire so good, but it comes down to a mix of great musicianship, rich sound (from the brass), exciting beats and phenomenal accents.
				</p>
				<p>
					I first heard the Aussie band back in the early 2000's. My sister had somehow found six of their songs, and eagerly shared them with me. Of these six songs, "<em>The Chariot</em>", "<em>Days Like These</em>" and "<em>Sly</em>" struck me and I've been a fan ever since. Then, we were treated to their album <em>So Many Nights</em> in 2006, which is still in my Top 3 Albums (up there with Lil Wayne's <em>Tha Carter III</em> and alt-j's <em>An Awesome Wave</em>). And now, seven years later, they have just released their sixth album: <em>Steal the Light</em>. I've only listened to it a few times, but it has the potential to reach my Top 3. Maybe.

				<p>
					Just in case you wanted to check for yourself, here's my favorite track from <em>Steal the Light</em>, called "<em>Still Young</em>".

				<h3>Something New</h3>

				<p>
					I love French rap. Don't get me wrong, I'm also a big fan of American rap (see more below). But French rap has something about it, something different that makes it so special. Personally, I'm of the belief that a strong emphasis on lyricism like the one found in traditional French music influenced the budding French Hip Hop scene of the 1980's. Mix that with the influences from overseas (so, really just New York), and you get French rap.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Golden Age" of French rap, according to many, was the mid-90's. Many big names were made during that time, and the concept of verlan was being established as a fundamental part of speech. For those unfamiliar with it, verlan is a way to manipulate words: a word is broken up into logical pieces - sometimes syllables, sometimes sounds - and is recombined after switching the pieces around. The word <em>verlan</em> is actual verlan for backwards, as the French word for backwards is "&agrave l'envers".
				</p>
				<p>
					All this is nice, but it's from almost 15 years ago. So why do I bring it up? Because one of my favorite artists out there is the French rap group <em>1995</em>. All six of them are from Paris and they're all under 23 years old. Their goal: make great music influenced by the Golden Age of French rap. I like to think they're doing a decent job of it, but that's just an opinion. If you want something more concrete, listen to the titular song from their first album: "<em>La Source</em>".

				<h3>Something Old</h3>
				<img src = "Music%20Photos/notorious_big.jpg" alt = "The Notorious B.I.G." />
				<img src = "Music%20Photos/tupac.jpg" alt = "Tupac" />
				<p>
					These guys need no introduction; they are the legends. <strong>The Notorious B.I.G.</strong> aka Biggie Smalls and <strong>Tupac Shakur</strong> stood alone above the rest and influenced Hip Hop in a way that hadn't yet and hasn't since been seen. When talking about rap, it's impossible not to mention these guys. Biggie told stories better than anyone, and did it with the type of smooth, deep voice that comes once in a lifetime. Pac, on the other hand, was a deeply talented wordsmith as well as the best poet in Hip Hop. One of two traits they both definitely shared was range; with a single song, either of these guys could get you ready to fight or weeping buckets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Together, they singlehandedly represented the American rap scene to the country and the rest of the world. We had a lover and a fighter. A bad boy and a thug. East Coast and West Coast. Unfortunately, the second trait that Tupac and Biggie shared is that they were both killed way before their time, and the world lost two great men. Thank the Lord that the world still has their great music.

				<h3>Something Fun</h3>
				<img class = "fun" src = "Music%20Photos/SHM.jpeg" alt = "Swedish House Mafia" />
				<img class = "fun" src = "Music%20Photos/wiz_khalifa.jpg" alt = "Wiz Khalifa" />
				<img class = "fun" src = "Music%20Photos/kanye.jpg" alt = "Kanye West" />
				<img class = "fun" src = "Music%20Photos/deadmau5.jpg" alt = "Deadmau5" />
				<p>
					Of course, every once in a while you really just want fun music, and that's where these guys come in. This is the music that you listen before, during, and after a night out. I've always been torn when it comes to fun-time music: do I want to go with Hip Hop or Electro? (<em>Really, we're talking more about House, Dubstep and the like but let's keep it simple</em>)
				</p>
				<p>
					The great thing is that the two genres have just been growing closer over the past few years to the point where you either have electro DJ's on the hook for rappers' songs (like Skrillex on A$AP Rocky's track) or a rapper on a DJ's track (like anything by Tinie Tempah). Either way, with a group like <strong>Swedish House Mafia</strong>, <strong>Wiz Khalifa</strong>, <strong>Kanye West</strong> and <strong>deadmau5</strong>, you can't really go wrong.
