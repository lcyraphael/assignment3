			<h2> Your New Favorite Jukebox </h2>
			<p>
				When I was a kid and someone asked me what kind of music I liked, I would always answer the same way: <em>'I like anything with a good beat'</em>. Going into seventh grade, I was twelve years old, I had just started drumming. I had never listened to  music much, and then all of a sudden it felt as if the floodgates had opened. I was being introduced to so many new genres, artists and songs, and I held on to as much as I could.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few years down the road, all of a sudden I'm sixteen and moving back to Paris to start my Junior year of high school. Three weeks into the school year, and I meet one of my best friends to date. Thanks to him, I was introduced to the amazing world of Hip Hop and I was immediately hooked. And that doesn't just include rap or even American music; the French Hip Hop scene and culture hit me like the best feeling ton of bricks in the world.

				And now, here we are, looking back at my musical history and my God does it look disjointed. But that's part of the fun, right?

				<p>
					Ok, easy place to start: <strong>The Cat Empire</strong>. These guys are hands down my favorite band. It's hard to describe what makes the Empire so good, but it comes down to a mix of great musicianship, rich sound (from the brass), exciting beats and phenomenal accents.
				</p>

					I first heard the Aussie band back in the early 2000's. My sister had somehow found six of their songs, and eagerly shared them with me. Of these six songs, "<em>The Chariot</em>", "<em>Days Like These</em>" and "<em>Sly</em>" struck me and I've been a fan ever since. Then, we were treated to their album <em>So Many Nights</em> in 2006, which is still in my Top 3 Albums (up there with Lil Wayne's <em>Tha Carter III</em> and alt-j's <em>An Awesome Wave</em>). And now, seven years later, they have just released their sixth album: <em>Steal the Light</em>. I've only listened to it a few times, but it has the potential to reach my Top 3. Maybe.

					Just in case you wanted to check for yourself, here's my favorite track from <em>Steal the Light</em>, called "<em>Still Young</em>".
