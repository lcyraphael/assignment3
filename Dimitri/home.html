			<h2> Welcome!</h2>
			<p>
				Hey there, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dimitri, and this is my first attempt at a website.
			</p>
			<p>
				First off, a little history. I'm half Greek, quarter Hungarian and quarter secret European blend. I was born in Washington DC, and lived there until I was six. I then moved to Paris (France, not Texas) and stayed <em>there</em> until I was fourteen. I spent two years in Athens, Greece before going back to Paris to finish high school. Now, I live in New Haven, CT and this has been my longest stay in one place since 6th grade.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, I'm not going to bore you to death with pages and pages of text. If you're wondering what I'm like, check out the Sports, Music, Movies and Food pages!
